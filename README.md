<H1>  Traffic Sign Classifier</H>

<H5>The Traffic Sign Classifier is a Convolution deeplearning model that classifies 43 classes of Traffic Signs. A Traffic Sign Classifier is very popularly used in self driving cars for its effectiveness in preventing road accidents.</H5>
<H5><a href = "https://github.com/4vedi/Traffic_Sign_Classifier/blob/master/Trafficsignclassifier.py">Code</a> is used to preprocess, Train and model Evaluation.</H>

<H5> DATASET: The Dataset used is German Traffic Sign Benchmarks(GTSRB) and can be downloaded from the link below</H5>
